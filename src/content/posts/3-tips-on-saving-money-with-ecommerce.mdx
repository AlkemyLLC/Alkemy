<h2 className="display-4">Invest in SEO</h2>
<p className="lead">Search engine optimization (SEO) isn't out of date. People still use the search engines, mostly Google, to search for products and services. Websites positioned higher up on the search engine results get the most attention and traffic. A website won't appear on page one without some effort on the part of a publisher. SEO work has become complicated in recent years. The rules have changed. Hiring a professional SEO firm is necessary for results that can do more than generate revenue. <a href="https://www.practicalecommerce.com/10-do-it-yourself-seo-tips-to-save-money" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Practical eCommerce</a> recommends learning about keywords, doing competition research, researching content strategies, and figuring out how to use social media effectively. SEO success may lead to saving money as well. <br/><br/>For one, putting money in reliable SEO work curtails spending on marketing strategies that might not deliver results. If SEO makes other expenses unnecessary, mark the extra costs for elimination.</p>

<h2 className="display-4">Look into Platform Benefits</h2>
<p className="lead">Third-party platforms provide other means for business owners to reach customers. Amazon, eBay, and Shopify represent three top platforms that help businesses and entrepreneurs move product. Additionally, these platforms provide benefits that entice buyers. Free shipping, discount offers, and more offers can motivate clients to buy. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://blog.shakr.com/the-shopify-plugins-your-ecommerce-store-should-be-using/" target="_blank">Shakr blog</a> mentions how there are many plugins and other tools that can connect with eCommerce platforms like Shopify to make the process of owning and running your shop easier.<br/><br/>Depending on the arranged deal, the platform may allow different fulfillment options. <a href="https://www.evolvedcommerce.com/fba-fees-are-they-worth-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Another source</a> explains, for example, Amazon offers two options for getting products to consumers: either FBM (Fulfillment by Merchant) or FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon). Despite the fees, they might end up saving you money in the long run. Why spend on packaging and mailing when a third-party will handle things for you? Plus, customers might be happy over the faster shipping service, leading to repeat business.</p>

<h2 className="display-4">Consult with Marketing Pros</h2>
<p className="lead">Jumping into an eCommerce strategy without carefully thinking things through can be a major error. The plan must be logical and work in concert with recent trends in online marketing. Otherwise, customers might not react in the desired way.
