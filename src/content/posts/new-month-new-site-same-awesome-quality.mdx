    As a tech company, it's important to always stay ahead of the trends. This is why we spend a great deal of time researching new technologies in the Web Sphere.
    </p>

    <p className="lead">Today we announce the re-launch of our website using some of the web's best technologies:</p>
    <ul className="lead">
        <li>Performance: We used GatsbyJS to ensure the site was blazing fast and stable.</li>
        <li>Automatic Updates: We've integrated background service workers to make sure you are always on the latest version!</li>
        <li>Installable App: Download and install the webapp for the best experience on your mobile device.</li>
        <li>Content without the Bloat: The new website uses Markdown-X which doesn't have all of the overhead of a CMS.</li>
        <li>and much more!</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="lead">
    As part of our commitment to ensure the most fluid and performant experience for all of our customers, we will continue to refine and extend our website. Stay tuned for future anouncements and thanks for being a part of our Alkemy Family!
    </p>
